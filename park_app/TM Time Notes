My first attempt:

Using Chronic...

start_time = Chronic.parse('Today 5PM').to_i
end_time = Chronic.parse('Tomorrow 3AM').to_i
range = start_time..end_time
range === Time.now.to_i OR range.include?(current_time)


"NO PARKING MIDNIGHT-6AM INCLUDING SUNDAY"
"NO PARKING SUNDAY & HOLIDAYS (SINGLE ARROW)"
"NO PARKING 1PM-MIDNIGHT SATURDAY (SINGLE ARROW)"
"NO PARKING ANYTIME MAY 15 - SEPT 30"
"NO PARKING 8AM-5PM MON THRU FRI"
"NO PARKING (SANITATION BROOM SYMBOL) 7:30-8:30AM EXCEPT SUN"
"NO PARKING ANYTIME EXCEPT TRUCKS"
"NO PARKING SAT SUN HOILDAYS MAY 15 - SEPT 30"
"NO PARKING 7-10AM 4-7PM MON THRU FRI"

"NO PARKING 7-9AM 4-7PM EXCEPT SUNDAY"
"NO PARKING (SANITATION BROOM SYMBOL) 11AM TO 12:30PM MON & THURS"
