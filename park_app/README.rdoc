This will ask SQL for a count of all the sign descriptions, ordered by count
of appearance in descending order.

``` sql
select count(signdescription), signdescription
from parkingspots
group by signdescription
order by count(signdescription) DESC;
```

no_parking.grep(/\d.*M\s/)

no_parking.map { |x| x[/\d.*M\s.*(^W|^\()/] }.compact
